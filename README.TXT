Tag Search is a simple little tool you can use to automatically create links in your posts using your tags. 

== Description ==

Tag search grabs your saved post tags and when a tag word or phrase is encountered in your post content, Tag Search automatically creates a link which is pointed to the search page to turn the tag into a search term. When the user clicks the linked tag word or phrase all posts found to contain the tag word or phrase will be returned in the results. This is different from similar plugins that link the tagged word or phrase to it's tag page so only those posts sharing the tag are returned.

== Screenshots ==


== Changelog ==

Version 1.7 - "Give credit to plugin author" functionality has been removed (this means: no more site wide links).
			- Settings link now available from the plugins' list.  Also, the settings has been moved from its own
			menu to a submenu of the main Wordpress settings.

Version 1.6 - Unfortunately, unknown due to a change in developer.

Version 1.5 - Added an on off switch so you can turn off Tag Search from admin if desired.
			- Now links only full words. Means, if tag to link is support and Tag Search finds the word 'supportive' Tag Search will
			now skip the word supportive instead of linking the 'support' part of the word 'supportive'

Version 1.4 - Changes alignment of footer credit to center instead of right

Version 1.3 - Fixes undefined index on line 182

Version 1.2 - Fixes error unexpected T_STRING on line 184
